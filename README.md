The syllabus covered the following topics:

- **Graph Theory:**
  - Graphs and subgraphs.
  - Trees, optimal spanning trees.
  - Optimal paths and optimal spanning trees.
  - Counting trees, rooted trees.
  - Prefix codes and Huffman’s algorithm.
  - Paths and distances.
  - Connectivity and construction of reliable communication networks.
